H-1B_Disclosure_Data_FY15to17.csv (prepared by H1B.py) is combined from 
['H-1B_Disclosure_Data_FY15_Q4.xlsx', 'H-1B_Disclosure_Data_FY16.xlsx', 'H-1B_Disclosure_Data_FY17.xlsx']
found at https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm


AND
76 duplicate/abnormal data are dropped based on common values in column ['CASE_NUMBER', 'CASE_STATUS'].
However, other meaningful duplicates are still existing.

For example, a unique CASE_NUMBER may have 2 records that contains different CASE_STATUS (certified and certified-withdraw).
In this scenario, both records (same CASE_NUMBER) are kept.
